  <!--
    I started with plain CSS. But then decided to go for my <3 Stylus.
    I thought that would be easier for your guys to detect traces of logic in my styles code.
    To run .stylus version. Please do `npm i -g stylus && stylus lovely-looking.css -o compiled.css`
    I've also included compiled version of styles in repo. I dont do that for real projects of course,
    but I was just a bit too lazy to set up all the npm package structure, webpack, static server, etc.
